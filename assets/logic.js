// Create array for cities

// Create blank array for letters guessed (push one var {i.e. letter guessed to an array})

// Press any key to get started

// Generate random index position from array

// Split the word into letters

// Display number of letters in word as that many underscores 

	// Count number of letters in word

	// Generate that many underscores

	// Change text displayed to underscores 

// Listen to key pressed

	// use that event.key as a variable 

// Check if userGuess matches anything in guessed array

	// IF it does match

		// do nothing (maybe go back to "listen to key pressed")

	// IF it doesn't

		// push that variable into guessed array

// Check if letter pressed matches any of the letters in the word

// IF letter matches

	// find the underscore of the position of the letter(s)	

	// change underscore(s) to that letter

// If letter doesn't match

	// add to letters already guessed

	// subtract one from guesses remaining

// If all letters guessed before guesses remaining = 0 (when guessed.length = original number of guesses)

	// (If guessed.length = number of guesses)

	// add 1 to wins

	// display picture of winning word

	// change text at top to winning word

	// reset letters already guessed (array)

	// reset guesses remaining

	// go back to step 2 (generate random word from list)

// If guesses remaining = 0 before all letters guessed

	// display game over
